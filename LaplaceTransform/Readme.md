# Laplace Transform
The Laplace transform is a fundamental analytical tool for characterizing probability distributions. Our research primarily focuses on two key statistical phenomena. We plan to expand our scope to include additional stochastic phenomena in future work.



## Fading distributions
Radio propagation is subject to small-scale fading, and the power of the received signal is distributed according to
* **Rayleigh** fading & Exponential distribution
* **Nakagami-m** fading & Gamma distribution
* **Rician** fading & Chi-square distribution 

More complex fading scenarios, combining multiple fading effects, will be explored in future research. 

## Point processes
Spatially distributed nodes can be modelled by 
* **Poisson point process** randomly and independently distributed nodes with an average density of $\lambda$
* **Binomial point process** randomly and independently distributed nodes with total number of $N$
* **Mat√©rn cluster process** is a two-level PPPs, see application in "../Example/"

More complex spatial distribution scenarios, such as clustered and repulsive point processes, will be explored in future research.
