Objective: investigating network constraints: interference-limited vs. noise-limited

Factors influence the interference level and distribution
* the role of RISs (the previous figure only considered the average value, however, the ergodic rate based on distribution of SINR will be more quantitatively informative)
* the transmitting power level / compared with the noise level
* BS density: high density, low density, middle density
