# Interference level w. approximation
This simulation aims to illustrate the order relationship of:
* the expected value of the direct interference
* the expected value of the reflected interference (key point)
* the noise level

Factors to consider:
* the distance between BS-UE (we probably consider the density the BSs)
* PL exponent of the reflected path between RISs to the tagged UE
* the beamwidth of the reflected beams 

Expected discussions:
