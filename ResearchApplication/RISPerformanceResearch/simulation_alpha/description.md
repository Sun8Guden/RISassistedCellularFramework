# This simulation is to investigate the components of the interference
The following can be obtained analytically based on the knowledge of the corresponding Laplace transforms 
* the average power of the interference from the interfering BSs
* the average power of the interference reflected from the interfering RISs
* the average power of the interference beamformed from the interfering RISs
* the average power of the interference scattered from the interfering RISs

Factors to consider:
* PL exponent of the reflected path between RISs to the tagged UE
* the beamwidth of the reflected beams, determining the probability of a randomly directed beam overlapping with the tagged UE

Conclusion: 
1. For the interference reflected by RISs, it is the beamformed part that dominates, and the scattered part can be negligible
2. When the beam is small, the probability overlapping between the randomly reflected beam and the tagged UE is low, the reflected interference can be negligible
3. When the cross cell pathloss is high, the pathloss of the reflected interference is high, the reflected interference can be negligible
