# A Software Tool for Analyzing RIS-Aided Cellular Networks Based on Stochastic Geometry
The code in this repository support 
* The paper "Sun, G., Baccelli, F., Feng, K., Garcia, L. U., Paris, S. (2023). Performance Analysis of RIS-assisted MIMO-OFDM Cellular Networks Based on Matern Cluster Processes. arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.06754"
* The workshop talk based on the slides "Slides_for_RIS_assisted_MIMO_Cellular_network_based_on_Matern_Cluster_Process.pdf"

Dependency: 
* Note that we use one dimensional integration solver from Boost library, which is impossible to push to GitHub repository for some reason. The user should download by themself and put it in the directory "/library/". Then, the code should work well.
